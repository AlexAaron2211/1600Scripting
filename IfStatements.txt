If Statements are conditional statements that executes code when one or another condition is fullfilled or "True"
Most 'If statements' are written like this

If ()
{
	//activate code when condition is met
}

an example would be

static void main(string args)
{
  Int x = 3;
  Int y = 7;

If (x<y)
{
	Console.Writeline("X is smaller than Y")
  }
}


static void main(string args)
{
   Int x = 6;
   Int y = 8;

If (x == y)
{
	Console.writeline("X is Equal to Y")
  }
}

if the statements is true than any thing within that if statement will activate.
most If statements use operators like < , > , = , + , - .
These operators make it much easier to determine if a condition is met or not.

Else is a tool used with If statements a lot and is used to constantly trigger one line of code until the if statement is
completed or true. You can use as many if/else statements as you want!
you can also use Else If to determine multiple answers to a question.
