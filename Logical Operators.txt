Logical Operators are used to join multiple characters and return a true or false statement
some common operators are
&& the And operator
|| the Or operator
!  the Not operator

theres a couple of ways "and" operators work, such as
false false false
false true false
true false false
true true true

these operators can be used to make the user use multiple inputs or check multiple boxes to enter a game or any number
of things.
you can use multiple conditions such as 

Int money = 120;
Int Age = 18;
If(age > 18 && <80 && money > 120)
  Console.writeline("You have money and youth")

the Or operator || returns true if any of the operators are true.
example:

Int Age = 18;
Int Rubies = 100;
If (age > 18 || Rubies > 100) {
   console.writeline("you got the game")
}

The Not operator makes true statements false, and false statements true.
example:

Int Money = 20;
if(!(money >= 20)) {
   Console.write("you have enough money")
}
